# TheSource_Rewards_APP

> An App created during the 2019 Bell IT Business Case Challenge.

**Overview**

Consumer electronics is a multi-billion dollar market which is changing everyday. As the ecommerce space has been booming the past
couple of years, Amazon has taken the lead in offering consumer products right to the door step within a few days. However, physical
stores are still popular as many consumers rather see and try out a product in-store before making the purchase. As the world
becomes more digitally connected through smartphones and various gadgets, this creates space for innovative ways to connect
consumers to visit stores and increase customer frequency and purchases.


Our task for the business case was to find a way to increase customer facing by encouraging customers to frequently visit stores
as well as increase the customer retention rate. To tackle this challenge, we have decided to implement a loyalty program in which
customers can scan a barcode on a rewards card or through a mobile app to later redeem in-store for merchandise or cash value on their
next purchase. This will drive customers to frequently visit stores and collect points increasing customer frequency. Moreover, this will
develop a better relation with the employee and customer leading them to further visit their local TheSource store.

For the technical aspect, we decided to develop an intuitive mobile rewards app as part of a loyalty program in which customers can gain & keep track of their points, view 
past transactions/rewards history, and view their user profile. Secure user authentication using email and Google accounts is done
using Firebase Authentication as well as Firebase database for real-time data storage/retrieval for account information such as rewards points.
In addition, we integrated Google DialogFlow for the creation of a Support Chatbot in which customers can have answers to common
questions done easily using Googles natural language processing and machine learning capabalities.
